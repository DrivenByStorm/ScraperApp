            "\n",
            "```bash\n",
            "pip install langchain\n",
            "```\n",

            "You: bash\n",

            "Assistant:  Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox and Chet Ramey, first released in 1989. It is a shell that follows the IEEE Std 1003.2 (POSIX) specification. Bash can be used for various tasks such as file manipulation, program execution, and running scripts. It is the default shell for most Linux and macOS systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some common Bash commands:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. `cd`: Changes the current directory. For example, `cd /home/user` will change to the directory /home/user.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. `mkdir`: Creates a new directory. For example, `mkdir mydir` will create a directory named mydir.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. `rm`: Removes files or directories. Be careful with this command, as it can delete files permanently.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. `rmdir`: Removes an empty directory.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. `cp`: Copies files or directories. For example, `cp file1 file2` will copy file1 to file2.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. `mv`: Moves or renames files or directories. For example, `mv oldfile newfile` will rename oldfile to newfile.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. `cat`: Concatenates and displays file content. For example, `cat file.txt` will display the content of file.txt.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. `echo`: Outputs the arguments it is given. For example, `echo \"Hello, World!\"` will output \"Hello, World!\".\n",
            "\n",
            "11. `grep`: Searches a string in files. For example, `grep \"Hello\" file.txt` will search for the string \"Hello\" in file.txt.\n",
            "\n",
            "12. `ls -l`: Lists files in long format, showing more detailed information such as file size, last modification date, and file permissions.\n",
            "\n",
            "13. `man`: Displays the manual page for a command. For example, `man ls` will display the manual page for the `ls` command.\n",
            "\n",

It inverting the dynamics of the system to compute control inputs that achieve desired trajectories [5]. NDI is particularly effective in fault-tolerant control systems, where it can adapt to actuator failures by reconfiguring control signals [6]. This approach is widely applied in autonomous landing systems for UAVs [14].\n"

            "Answer: ◁think▷Okay, let's try to figure out the failure cases mentioned in the simulation study. Looking at the first context block, there's a mention of three cases. The third case specifically decreases the efficiency of pitch and yaw thrusters by 40% and 60% respectively at 6 seconds after launch. So that's one failure scenario. \n",
            "\n",
            "The second context block has a figure comparing ballistic trajectories and error variations for three cases. The captions mention Case1, Case2, and Case3. Since the third case was described in the first context, maybe Case1 and Case2 are other failure scenarios. But the first context also mentions that in the third case, they test further by decreasing efficiencies. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, the first context says \"In the third case, to test the performance further, the efficiency of both pitch and yaw thrusters are decreased...\" So Case3 is definitely one of the failure cases. But what about Case1 and Case2? The user might have other failure types. Let me check again. The first context mentions that simulations are initiated without the deep neural network first, then with LSTM integrated. The variations of state elements before and after failure are shown in Figs 5,6,7. So each case probably has a different failure scenario.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the first context, the third case is when both thrusters' efficiencies are decreased. The other cases might be different failures. Maybe Case1 is a single thruster failure, like pitch or yaw, and Case2 another combination. But the exact details aren't clear. However, the user's question is to list the failure cases considered. Based on the information given, the main failure case mentioned is the third one with both pitch and yaw efficiencies reduced. The other cases might be different parameter changes or other faults, but without more details, I can only confirm the third case. Wait, the first context says \"In the third case, to test the performance of the proposed architecture further, the efficiency of both pitch and yaw thrusters are decreased by amounts of %40 and %60 at 6 seconds after the launch respectively.\" So that's one failure. But maybe the other cases involve other parameters or different times. However, the user's context doesn't specify those. So perhaps the answer should include the three cases as mentioned in the figures, but the specific failures are not detailed except for Case3. \n",
            "\n",
            "But the user's question is \"What failure cases are considered in the simulation study?\" So the answer should list the different failure scenarios. From the first context, Case3 is a known failure. The other cases might be other parameter changes. The figures (5,6,7) show variations for all cases. So perhaps each case has a different failure. For example, Case1 might be a failure in pitch thruster, Case2 in yaw, and Case3 in both. But the exact details aren't given except for Case3. \n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe the first two cases are nominal or less severe, and the third is more challenging. But the user's answer needs to be based on the provided context. The only explicit failure mentioned is the third case with efficiency decreases. So perhaps the answer is that three cases are considered, with the third being the most severe. But the user wants the failure cases, so maybe all three are failures. Wait, the first context says \"fixing parameter dat0.1 at 6 seconds\" in the first two sentences. Maybe that's a failure scenario where a parameter is fixed. But it's hard to parse. The text seems to have some formatting issues, like missing spaces. For example, \"fixingparameterdat0.1at6seconds\" should be \"fixing parameter dat 0.1 at 6 seconds\". So maybe in the first case, a parameter is fixed, and in the third case, efficiencies are decreased. But without more context, it's hard to tell. \n",
            "\n",
            "Given the information, the answer should include the three cases, but the specific failures are not fully clear. However, the user's example answer in the prompt (if any) isn't provided. But based on the available data, the third case is definitely a failure with thruster efficiency drops. The other cases might be other parameter changes. So the answer would list the three cases as per the figures, but the exact failures are not fully specified. But the user's question is to state what failure cases are considered. So perhaps the answer is:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Case 1: Parameter dat fixed at 0.1 at 6 seconds\n",
